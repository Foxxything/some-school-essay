Throughout the series of books I have read, one topic that remains consistent is the discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. We will explore in-depth sexuality discrimination, trans discrimination, and the negative effects of gender roles. All topics are present in the books "Keeping You a Secret," "Felix Ever After," and "To Kill a Mockingbird."


In the book “Keeping You a Secret” we can see Holland and Cece get hated for their sexuality. We can see the abuse they receive from other people several times throughout the book. Examples of this can get seen such as when three male guys had Cece cornered against a vending machine saying things such as “Come on, one kiss. Try it, you’ll like it” one of them shortly followed this by slamming Cece against the vending machine. Then he says “Feel this? Huh?” The problem is that all of this still happens to this day—the abuse, the assault—and it likely won’t stop happening. There will always be people who consider the LGBTQ as “less than”, “not human” or somebody who thinks they need to die.


While reading the book “Felix Ever After,” it’s made clear that people will go to great lengths for dumb things. Austin creates an Instagram account where he messages the protagonist transphobic messages, such as “I’m not trolling you. I’m just telling you the truth. You were born a girl. You’ll always be a girl.” We can see things like this happening multiple times throughout the book. Transphobia can be seen taking many forms in this book.
<!-- can we? idk im really guessing here foxx -->

In the book “To Kill a Mockingbird” one characters name is Scout Finch. Scout shows "tomboyish" behaviour, such as not wanting to wear a dress, or wanting to follow what all the boys wore doing. There are all these gender roles applied to us at a young age that we must abide by—lest we get seen as an outcast or different, and so what? I say to hell with gender roles, as they have no positive effects, but they have negative ones. In 2016, a study showed that only 10% of primary school teachers are men and that 38% of dads lie to their boss to take time off to spend time with their children. In the story, we can see that Scout gets discriminated against for not following the rules that society has set in place for being a female. In my essay, I follow the theme of LGBTQ discrimination, and while a tomboy is not part of the LGBTQ community; it follows the same concept.


In my essay, we follow the theme of LGBTQ discrimination. In “Keeping You a Secret,” this takes the form of Cece and Holland getting hated on for whom they dated. in “Felix Ever After,” this takes the form of Felix getting hated for being trans. Finally, in “To Kill a Mockingbird,” this takes the form of scout getting hated for wanting to break the gender norms.
